# Expression Recognition Model

## Abstract
This project focuses on the development and implementation of an expression recognition model designed to accurately identify and interpret human facial expressions. The importance of expression recognition encompasses enhancing human-computer interaction, improving security, offering insights into human emotions, and supporting applications across healthcare, marketing, education, and entertainment. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this model aims to create intuitive and empathetic user experiences, contribute to psychological research, and provide personalized content and services.
